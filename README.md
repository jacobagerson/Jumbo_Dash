# ES4 Digital Logic Final Project: Jumbo Accelerator Chrome Game
Designed and implemented an interactive accelerator game based on the Google Chrome browser dino game entirely in VHDL on an FPGA; Custom sprites and animations. Inputs from NES controler and output on 640 x 480 VGA display; Used Lattice Radiant for synthesis, modeling, and implementation-programmed to iCE40UP5k-SG48I FPGA.  

This project is a Chrome Dino Accelerator/Geometry Dash inspired game built exclusively through sequintial logic in VHDL. Play as a cute Jumbo sprite running passed the obstacles. We used one NES controller for jump, duck, and start inputs.
